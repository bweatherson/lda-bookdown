How to extract alt-text (more or less)

Make a copy of the book that includes the md
   bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', clean = FALSE)
   Need to not specify files by format for this. Not sure why.
   
Use BBEdit to extract all the lines
  Text > Process Lines Containing img src
  
Then delete the junk (grep on for these searches)
    Find: ^.*?alt
    Replace: alt
    Find alt="
    Replace: blank
    Find: width = ...
    Replace: blank
    
This will give them a list of all the alt-text
