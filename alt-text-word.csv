The categories are Aesthetics, Epistemology, Ethics, History of Philosophy, Idealism, Logic and Mathematics, Metaphysics, Philosophy of Language, Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Religion, Philosophy of Science, Social and Political. The frequencies are described briefly in the text below, then in much more detail in chapter 4. The key point here is that even though this is a scatterplot, it looks like a line graph. The year-to-year changes in how much each topic is represented are tiny."
Figure 1.1 - ,"A scatterplot where the x-axis shows how often each word appears in D. C. Makinson (1965) &quot;The Paradox Of The Preface&quot; Analysis 25:205-207., and the y-axis shows how often the model anticipated that word to appear. Here the expectations are rarely met. The words rational, beliefs, belief, paradox, book are highlighted. Each of them is well below the 45 degree line. That means they appear in the article more often than the model expects. The word belief only appears a bit more often than expected, then others appear much more often."
Figure 1.2 - ,"A scatterplot where the x-axis shows how often each word appears in Donald Davidson (1990) &quot;The Structure And Content Of Truth&quot; Journal of Philosophy 87:279-328., and the y-axis shows how often the model anticipated that word to appear. Here the expectations are usually met. The words truth, true, theory, sentences, language are highlighted. Each of them is close to the 45 degree line. That means they appear in the article about as often than the model expects. The word truth appears a lot; it is 6% of the words in the article. The model expects a little less; around 5%. The others are very close to the 45 degree line."

Here the expectations are usually met. The words conditional, true, truth, conditionals, belief are highlighted. Each of them is close to the 45 degree line. That means they appear in the article about as often than the model expects."

Here the expectations are usually met. The words moral, argument, morality, might, claim are highlighted. Each of them is close to the 45 degree line. That means they appear in the article about as often than the model expects. The word moral appears a lot, about 4% of all words in the article. And the model predicts this correctly."

Here the expectations are rarely met. The words properties, clay, part, time, property are highlighted. Each of them is far frothe 45 degree line. The model expects the words property and properties will appear a lot, 3-4% of the time, but they make up only about 1% of the words. It does not expect the words time, part and, especially, clay, to appear as often as they do."

Here the expectations are rarely met. The words revenge, social, norms, honor, society are highlighted. Each of them is far from to the 45 degree line. The model expects the words society and social to appear more often than they do. But it is very surprised at how often the words honor, norms, and revenge, appear."

Here the expectations are rarely met. The words world, disposition, true, possible, worlds are highlighted. Four of them are far from the 45 degree line. The model expects the words possible, worlds and, especially, world, to appear much more often than they do. But it expects the word disposition to appear much less. The model does correctly predict that the word true will appear about 2% of the time."

Here the expectations are mostly met. The words world, laws, past, future, worlds are highlighted. Four of them are close to the 45 degree line. But the model expects the word laws to appear much more often than it does."

Here the expectations are mostly met. The words metaphor, concept, concepts, time, language are highlighted. Four of them are close to the 45 degree line. That means they appear in the article about as often than the model expects. But the model does not expect the word metaphor to appear so often."

Here the expectations are rarely met. The words reasons, epistemic, belief, rationality, reason are highlighted. Belief and reason are far above the 45 degree line, epistemic and rationality far below it. The model expects the word reasons to make up 2% of the words in the article, and in fact it makes up 3%."
