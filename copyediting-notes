Italics in tables - the software doesn't seem to let me do italics inside searchable tables. So the citations in the tables don't have the journal names italicized. I'm a bit annoyed by this, but I can't figure out a way around it.

Note 15 - I rewrote this paragraph
Note 16 - I changed this word to 'substantive'
Page 41 - St Andrews weirdly enough doesn't have a full stop after 'St'. At least, the official house style the university there promotes leaves it out, so I'm leaving it out too.
Note 19 - Good point about So; I've tried to limit it here
Page 54 - I left in the "It snapped" line because i think it's clear enough, and funnier if it's shorter
Note 21 - Good catch; that's a ratio not a percentage
Note 22 - I think it should have been bolded on first use only
Note 23 - Yes, that's much clearer
Note 24 - Yes, this is a term from logic, or at least from logic as done 80 years ago
Note 25 - That's better, thanks
Note 26 - I rewrote this, and the surrounding sentences, to make them clearer
Note 27 - The missing table is searchable, and didn't print in the Word version. I'll have to make sure this is adjusted for the print version. This is true for most of the missing tables
Note 29 - Yes, this is intentional. It's commonly used in 19th century psychology articles
Note 30 - Agreed
Note 34 - Yes, I was being sloppy about US/America. It's good to be clearer that this means US.
Note 38-40 - Yes, there is an image there.
Note 43 - This is a tricky one - but I think it's a book. The 1938 reprint, which I'm talking about, is a book.
Note 44 - The category labels are from me, so it shouldn't matter whether we use US or UK spelling in them.
