Note 15 - I rewrote this paragraph
Note 16 - I changed this word to 'substantive'
Page 41 - St Andrews weirdly enough doesn't have a full stop after 'St'. At least, the official house style the university there promotes leaves it out, so I'm leaving it out too.
Note 19 - Good point about So; I've tried to limit it here
Page 54 - I left in the "It snapped" line because i think it's clear enough, and funnier if it's shorter
Note 21 - Good catch; that's a ratio not a percentage
Note 22 - I think it should have been bolded on first use only
Note 23 - Yes, that's much clearer
Note 24 - Yes, this is a term from logic, or at least from logic as done 80 years ago
Note 25 - That's better, thanks
