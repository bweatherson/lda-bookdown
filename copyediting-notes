Note 15 - I rewrote this paragraph
Note 16 - I changed this word to 'substantive'
Page 41 - St Andrews weirdly enough doesn't have a full stop after 'St'. At least, the official house style the university there promotes leaves it out, so I'm leaving it out too.

Page 54 - I left in the "It snapped" line because i think it's clear enough, and funnier if it's shorter
