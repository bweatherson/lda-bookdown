Scatterplots showing the proportion of articles in each year that are in each of the 12 categories the book uses. The categories are Aesthetics, Epistemology, Ethics, History of Philosophy, Idealism, Logic and Mathematics, Metaphysics, Philosophy of Language, Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Religion, Philosophy of Science, Social and Political. The frequencies are described briefly in the text below, then in much more detail in chapter 4. The key point here is that even though this is a scatterplot, it looks like a line graph. The year-to-year changes in how much each topic is represented are tiny.
A scatterplot where the x-axis shows how often each word appears in D. C. Makinson (1965) &quot;The Paradox Of The Preface&quot; Analysis 25:205-207., and the y-axis shows how often the model anticipated that word to appear. Here the expectations are rarely met. The words rational, beliefs, belief, paradox, book are highlighted. Each of them is well below the 45 degree line. That means they appear in the article more often than the model expects. The word belief only appears a bit more often than expected, then others appear much more often.
A scatterplot where the x-axis shows how often each word appears in Donald Davidson (1990) &quot;The Structure And Content Of Truth&quot; Journal of Philosophy 87:279-328., and the y-axis shows how often the model anticipated that word to appear. Here the expectations are usually met. The words truth, true, theory, sentences, language are highlighted. Each of them is close to the 45 degree line. That means they appear in the article about as often than the model expects. The word truth appears a lot; it is 6% of the words in the article. The model expects a little less; around 5%. The others are very close to the 45 degree line.
