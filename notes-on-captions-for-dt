**Getting captions on DataTables**

Have to search for datatable and author_dt, which is a function which calls datatable. 
  For latter, caption should be "Articles with author "y".", where y is author.

In code chunk, after datatable
>> cat("<table>",paste0("<caption>", "(#tab:code-chunk-name)", "caption", "Here's my caption", "</caption>"),"</table>", sep ="\n")

After code chunk
>> Tab: \@ref(tab:code-chunk-name)

To do
  - Change the actual datatables
  - Check any of this works in Word
  - Reprogram author_dt
  - Fix the references to author_dt
