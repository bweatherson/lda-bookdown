Changes between HTML and Word versions

index.Rmd
31 - Comment/uncomment kableExtra (and make sure it is detached from regular R session)
486 - Remove full_width
1030-50 - Comment out because it is for website only
1511 - Remove full_width

For rest of the way, use bbedit to multifile search for 'full_width' and comment/uncomment

  Ugh so much
